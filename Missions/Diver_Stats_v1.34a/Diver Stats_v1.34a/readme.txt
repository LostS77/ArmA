--Diver Stats created by trini scourge--

Please read the included PDF File "Diver Stats Info" for more information on configuration and customization.
-----------------------------------------

Diver Stats is an attempt to introduce a simulation of real world underwater dynamics to Arma 3. It is meant mainly for Open Circuit Scuba Diving.

The Dive Mate (Diver stats display) overtly tracks : 
							Depth from surface (feet).
							Pressure (based on depth from surface).
							Air Consumption Rates.
							Scuba Tank Size.
							Maximum Depth reached.
							Positional and Directional information.
							Temperature. (C and F)
							Breathing Time Remaining.
							Dive Time.
							Type of breathing gas mix.
							Blood Nitrogen percentage.
							Tissue Saturation Levels.
							Ascent Time (Time to Surface).
							Ascent Rate.
							Maximum Operational Depth. (MOD)
							Ascent Ceilings (Decompression Stops).

Diver Stats covertly tracks many, many more variables, down to the solubility of a particular breathing gas at a particular depth. All of this information is pumped back into the Dive Mate Display, so that the diver can have all of the required information at his/her fingertips.

In addition to visual information, the Dive Mate Display provides audio cues to keep the diver aware of: Fast Ascent Rates, surpassing recommended Tissue Saturation Levels and Maximum Operational Depth, and even sounds off to let the diver know that they have passed their No Decompression Limit (NDL).
